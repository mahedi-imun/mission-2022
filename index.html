                <p>Ramganj is an upazila of Lakshmipur District in the Division of Chittagong, Bangladesh. The seat lies at Ramganj town, which is 121 kilometres by road southeast of Dhaka.This area was home to an influential Hindu religious leader by the name of Ram after who Ramganj was named after. The Nagmud Madrasa was founded in Ramganj in 1856. In 1891, a thana (police outpost) was established in Ramganj. The Noakhali riots spread to Ramganj on 10 October 1946, and led to heavy casualties for several days. In response, Mahatma Gandhi arrived from Delhi as an appeal. </p>
